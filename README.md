# Where's Waldo (Photo Tagging App)

This project is the classic "Where's Waldo" game built with React and Firebase

## Overview

Where's Waldo is a game where the goal is to find Waldo (along with other characters) as fast as possible. Characters are hidden within a 'busy' photo. Once the user clicks on all characters, the level is complete. If found fast enough, the user may enter their name for the leaderboard where fastest times are tracked.

## Functionality

The user can choose from four different levels, each with increasing difficulty. Once a level is selected, the game starts. Each level has a different set of characters which are shown above the game board. When a character is clicked on, a message will appear confirming which character was found and the character image will turn grey. Once all characters are found, a prompt will appear confirming all characters were found and the amount of time it took. A global leaderboard can be accessed from the home screen

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
